This notebook was written on 30/04/2023 as a self-assignment to train a little my skills in algorithm writing and explaining.

It aims to explain and prove empirically the solution to the Monty Hall statistical Paradox (Wikipedia page on the problem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

It's copyright free, you can download it from its GitHub project page at https://github.com/RAGilardi/Monty-Hall-Problem-Empirical-Solution.

This complete notebook was written in one session, so the code won't probably be completely optimized and there might be minor errors. If you have any suggestions, please write them in the issue session of the GitHub project at https://github.com/RAGilardi/Monty-Hall-Problem-Empirical-Solution/issues.
