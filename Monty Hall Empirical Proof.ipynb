    "# Monty Hall Problem Empirical Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Premise of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was written as a self-assignment to train a little my skills in algorithm writing and explaining on 30/04/2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "It aims to explain and prove empirically the solution to the Monty Hall statistical Paradox (Wikipedia page on the problem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's copyright free, you can download it from its GitHub project page at https://github.com/RAGilardi/Monty-Hall-Problem-Empirical-Solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This complete notebook was written in one session, so the code won't probably be completely optimized and there might be minor errors. If you have any suggestions, please write them in the issue session of the GitHub project at https://github.com/RAGilardi/Monty-Hall-Problem-Empirical-Solution/issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will be divided into three main sessions:\n",
    "- First, I will briefly present the problem and its formal solution\n",
    "- Then, I will present a commented code which will explain the logic behind my solution\n",
    "- Finally, I will present an automated version of the first script which will derive the empirical demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem and its explanation\n",
    "Quoting Craig F. Whitaker's letter from Parade magazine (1990):\n",
    "\"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors:\n",
    "- Behind one door is a car;\n",
    "- behind the others, goats.\n",
    "\n",
    "You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### solution:\n",
    "This problem is often referred to as a paradox as the solution is not the most intuitive:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is statistically a safer choice to change the door after the host shows us there is a Goat behind one of the unchosen doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because with the prior knowledge we have (we know initially there were 3 possible choices and we picked a random door), we know it is still true that we had 1/3 of the chances to pick the right door and 2/3 of picking the wrong one.\n",
    "Opening a wrong door doesn't change this probability and when the are presented with the opportunity to change our first pick it's just wrong to think we have a 50/50 chance of winning. We still have a 2/3 probability of having chosen the wrong door in the first place. This probability now is simply \"accumulated\" on the remaining door we didn't pick.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 50/50 probability would apply just to a new player, who didn't know there were initially three closed doors. More on that in the final solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my code, for the sake of simplicity, I will always let Monty Hall choose randomly which door to open for us, between the possible unpicked and not winning doors."
